# React + Vite + Framer-Motion

# 🚀 Framer Motion Practice Playground

This repository contains my hands-on practice with **Framer Motion**, focusing on animations involving `div` tags, images, and article scroll effects. It's a visual journey into the world of smooth, responsive, and interactive UI animations using the power of **Framer Motion** with **React**.

## 📖 About the Project

This project is a practice ground to explore and implement **Framer Motion animations**. It covers a variety of motion effects applied to:

- `div` containers (hover, click, and enter animations)
- Images (zoom-in, fade, and movement transitions)
- Article elements (scroll-based animations with fade-in and slide-in effects)

The goal is to get hands-on experience with motion components, transitions, and interaction-based animations in a React environment.
